Jcrop Image Cropping Plugin
===========================

Jcrop is the quick and easy way to add image cropping functionality to
your web application. It combines the ease-of-use of a typical jQuery
plugin with a powerful cross-platform DHTML cropping engine that is
faithful to familiar desktop graphics applications.

### Feature Overview

  * Attaches unobtrusively to any image or block element
  * Completely based on true prototypical Javascript objects for extreme flexibility
  * Supports multiple active selections, per-selection customization
  * Supports aspect ratio locking, minimum/maximum size, and other features
  * Acts as in-line form element, can receive focus, tab through
  * Keyboard support for nuding selections and trapping other keys
  * Inherently API-driven and stylable with CSS
  * Mobile touch support for iOS and Android

### Cross-platform Compatibility

The current version of Jcrop has been cross-platform tested and core functionality
works in all the following browsers:

  * Firefox 3+
  * Safari 4+
  * Opera 9.5+
  * Google Chrome 14+
  * Internet Explorer 7+

Older versions of some browsers may also work.

Always thoroughly test any desired functionality on all target platforms and devices.

##### Legacy IE Compatibility

Internet Explorer 6 suffers some visual problems with the new CSS structure
and will not be explicitly supported from v2.x and up. Currently Jcrop can still
be used in IE6, it just looks ugly. IE7 and newer versions deliver a nearly flawless
Jcrop experience.
